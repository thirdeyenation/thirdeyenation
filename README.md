- 👋 Hi, I’m @Woix. The Owner and Founder of Third Eye Nation.
- 👀 I’m interested in Original Music and Film Production, Digital Marketing, Social Media Management, SEO, Web-Development, AI Agent Development, Cryptocurrency & Financial Markets, as well as Community Development and Talent Acquisition. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code using Python, and am at best a beginner in the field. My focus at the moment of writing is to learn the basics and find what suits my needs. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the building and development of fully functional AI Agent Team UI for the everyday person. My goal is to have a completed team of AI agents that can execute commands of all kinds, allowing for users to get everything they need from one source.
- 📫 For those who are interested in joining this journey and possibly finding a position with Third Eye Nation, please send all inquiries to connect@thirdeyenation.ca .

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been sober for over 3 years following an overdose that resulted in me needing two narcan kits, a full team of Emergency Responders, and the homeless man I just so happened to let live with me at the time keeping me alive until the ambulance arrived. I was told that I was dead for 6 seconds. No pulse, not breathing on my own. Today I have accomplished more in my three years of being sober than I have my whole life, and I use that day for inspiration to continue on in making the world a better place.
